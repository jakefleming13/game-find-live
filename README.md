## Overview
GameFind is a video game discovery web application designed to help you find new and exciting games to play. Leveraging the comprehensive video game data provided by the RAWG IO API, GameFind offers a user-friendly interface to explore a vast library of games, complete with details such as descriptions, genres, release dates, store links, ratings, and much more.

This project served as an invaluable introduction to modern web development with React, TypeScript, and responsive design principles using Bootstrap. Through the development of GameFind, I gained practical experience in building reusable React components, effectively managing application state, implementing various React hooks, and deploying a full-stack web application.

## Technologies Used
- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- TypeScript: A statically typed superset of JavaScript1 that enhances code2 maintainability and helps prevent errors. Â  
- Bootstrap: A popular CSS framework for building responsive and mobile-first websites.
- RAWG IO API: A comprehensive video game database providing rich information about games. (Learn more at https://rawg.io/apidocs)
- Vercel: A platform for deploying and hosting web applications (current deployment).
